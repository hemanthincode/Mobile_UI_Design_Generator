# Mobile UI Design Generator

The Mobile UI Design Generator is a Python application that generates mobile user interface (UI) designs based on user input descriptions. It utilizes advanced AI models, specifically GPT-2 for text generation and Stable Diffusion for image generation, to create unique and modern mobile UI designs.

## Features

- **Text Prompt Generation**: Generates detailed prompts for mobile UI designs using the GPT-2 model.
- **Image Generation**: Creates images of mobile UI designs based on generated prompts using the Stable Diffusion model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact with the application via a simple command-line interface.

List of Python libraries:

diffusers
transformers
torch
Pillow  # For handling images

Explanation of Dependencies:
diffusers: This is the library you used for image generation (Stable Diffusion).
transformers: This is for the GPT-2 model used for text generation.
torch: PyTorch is the backend for both diffusers and transformers models.
Pillow: This is for working with images (to save, display, and manipulate the generated designs).
